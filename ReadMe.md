## Get started in 10 Minutes!

### Get Endofunctor and a server

```typescript
// Vixeny is just a handler, a server that gives a Request and expects a Response is needed

//Deno

import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.159.0/http/server.ts";

//Bun

Bun.serve()

export default {
  fetch: fun()() ,
}

// Get Vixeny

//Deno

import fun from ("npm:vixeny")
import fun from "https://deno.land/x/endofunctor/fun.ts";

//Bun 

import fun from ("vixeny")
```

## Give a path and a function

```typescript
// The function has to return a valid BodyInit or Promise<BodyInit>
await serve(
  fun()([
    {
      path: "/",
      f: (_) => "hello world",
    },
  ]),
  { port: 8080 },
);
```

## Add parameters, a query, a status, or a header

```typescript
// The router auto-detects if you are using parameters, queries, or Request unless you send the arguments out of the scope
// r: (arguments) => outOfScope(arguments),
// You can add or remove them with "add" or "delete"

await serve(
  fun(
    { hasName: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/" },
  )([
    {
      path: "/test/:id",
      status: 201,
      headers: ".html", // { 'Content-Type' : 'text/html'}
      f: (f) => f.param.id + " " + (f.query?.hello || ""),
    },
  ]),
  { port: 8080, hostname: "127.0.0.1" },
);
```

## Parameters

```typescript
"/hello/:id";
"/hello/:id/";
"/hello/:id/:page/:time";
"/hello/:id/:page/:time/";
"/hi/:id/page/:time";
```

## Do you need more control?

```typescript
// Use the type: "request" to return a Response or Promise<Response>
// You can use params and query here too!

await serve(
  fun(
    { hasName: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/" },
  )([
    {
      type: "request",
      path: "/abc",
      f: (f) => new Response(f.query?.hello || "abc"),
    },
  ]),
  { port: 8080, hostname: "127.0.0.1" },
);
```

## Do you need Functor just to route your function? I've got you covered!

```typescript
// Use the type: "response" to return a Response or Promise<Response>
await serve(
  fun(
    { hasName: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/" },
  )([
    {
      type: "response",
      path: "/",
      r: (_) => new Response("hello world"),
    },
  ]),
  { port: 8080, hostname: "127.0.0.1" },
);
```

## Static file is natively built-in Endofunctor!
***It only supports one, this will be solved in the future***
```typescript
// "path" is relative to the terminal
// Remove mime types with mime: false
// Add mime with extra: [ [header, extension]]
await serve(
  fun(
    { hasName: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/" },
  )([
    {
      type: "static",
      name: "/s/",
      path: "./static/",
    },
  ]),
  { port: 8080, hostname: "127.0.0.1" },
);
```

Thanks and have fun ~

# Specifications

## Route options

```typescript
type funRouterOptions = {
  hasName?: string;
  paramsStartsWith?: string;
  notFound?: (x: Request) => Response;
  badMethod?: (x: Request) => Response;
};
```

- **"hasName"**: It is the name of the server, and it always has to finish with "/", for example: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/". The router will be 5% faster if a name is given.

- **"paramsStartsWith"**: By default, a parameter is defined by ":" next to a "/". Changing this value will take the first character and check if it's followed by "/" to start a new parameter.

- **"notFound"**: Changes the default NOT_FOUND.

- **"badMethod"**: Changes the default BAD_METHOD.

## Methods

There are four methods:

```typescript
type ParamsMethod = "GET" | "HEAD" | "POST" | "DELETE";
```

## Experimental

***These methods can change over time and are not finished.***

### Stringifier

A JSON Stringifier based on JSONSchema. It is important to notice that:
- It does not verify the JSON.
- It cannot fail.
- If a key is missing and it is required, it will be "null". Otherwise, it will not be added to the final string.

Example usage:

```typescript
{
  schema:{
    json:{
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        hello: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            hello: { type: "string" },
          },
        },
      },
      required: ["hello"],
    }
  }
}
```

## Q&A

- **Why is Node.js not supported?**
  
  - The Node.js server does not support the Response and Request utilized by Vixeny.

- **Why is Vixeny so fast?**

 - ***Efficient Function Resolution:*** Vixeny leverages unique tools, "Atlas" and "Solver," streamlining function execution. Using set and category theory principles, it smartly composes functions in the same execution context as the caller. This approach enhances function resolution speed significantly.

 - ***Stack-Savvy Memory Management:*** By utilizing stack memory, exploiting symmetry, and restricting itself to primitives, Vixeny achieves optimized memory management. It mitigates heap usage, promoting swift stack operations and ensuring data immutability. This memory strategy further amplifies Vixeny's speed.

 - ***No Looping nor Named Recursion:*** Vixeny capitalizes on the symmetrical properties of sets and categories, negating the need for looping or recursion (inside of the return function and uses Y combinator (fix point) due the lack of context to set up some functions). By inferring results for equivalent paths (or the lack of them) in the code or data, it eradicates redundancy and unnecessary computation, contributing to its superior efficiency.

 - ***JIT Compiler Optimizations:*** By resolving everything simultaneously without a context, Vixeny creates a unique environment that encourages the JIT compiler to compile the code in a particular manner (this is a simplification that does not do justice to what really happens). This strategy provides the JIT compiler with more opportunities to identify and (hopefully) apply optimizations. The primary motivation behind this technique is to manipulate the JIT compiler into parsing and compiling all elements concurrently. This approach is instrumental in further enhancing the performance and speed of Vixeny.

and there are more things like the optimization of the functions given from the user, but it will not be covered...
  
Vixeny is not just a tool; it's a tribute to the power and potential of functional programming. It is the culmination of over 1,000 hours of research and meticulous design testing, dedicated to unraveling and exploiting the inherent strengths of functional programming. Vixeny showcases how the principles of function composition, immutability, combinators and leveraging set and category theory can lead to a system with robust efficiency, speed, and remarkable memory management. It's an ode to the beauty of functional programming that pushes its boundaries, transforms theory into practice, and encourages us all to envision new possibilities. To every functional programmer out there, Vixeny is a testament to your craft, an embodiment of your work's potential.

If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask and post a good issue!
